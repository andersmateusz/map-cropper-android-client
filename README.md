# About
This is a project of Android application that allows for cropping images of maps as a client of a SOAP web server. The project is based on Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI, which is Jetpack Compose.
It is possible to crop the image by providing GPS coordinates or pixel coordinates via form.
It is also possible to crop the image by drawing a box on the image. Cropping works via SOAP protocol so it is necessary to have SOAP server set.
You can download the SOAP server in my other repository: https://github.com/andersmateusz/map-cropper-web-service.git
